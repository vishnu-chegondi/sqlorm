# SqlOrm

SqlOrm is used to interact with databases using native go language. Usually ORM(Object Relational Mapper) is used to convert database data primitives to objects in native languages. But in Golang we do not have OOP's concept to handle them as objects. Alternative is to use **struct** in golang.
